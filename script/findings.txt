Overall, it is clear that Capomulin outperforms all other treatment options in the screen.
Capomulin was the only treatment to reduce tumor volume. It held to a 19% reduction in tumor volume over the course of trial, whereas all other drugs were correlated with an increase in tumor volume by roughly 40-50%.
Capomulin greatly limited the spread of the tumor compared to other treatment options. By study end, the average mouse on Capomulin had only 1 new metastatic site, as opposed to the average 2-3 found in mice of other treatment options.
Lastly, mice on the Capomulin treatment had the highest survival rate of any treatment in the screen. Over 90% of mice treated by Capomulin survived the full duration of the trial, compared to only 35-45% of mice on other treatment options.
