# Cancer Tumor Growth Analysis

My objecteive was to compile, and analyze data pertaining to how different drug trials affected cancer tumor growth on mice. Using Pandas, and Matplotlib I was able to create a few insightful visualizations helping make decisions on which drug performed best.

### Analysis Findings

- Overall, it is clear that Capomulin outperforms all other treatment options in the screen.
- Capomulin was the only treatment to reduce tumor volume. It held to a 19% reduction in tumor volume over the course of
trial, whereas all other drugs were correlated with an increase in tumor volume by roughly 40-50%.
- Capomulin greatly limited the spread of the tumor compared to other treatment options. By study end, the average mouse on
Capomulin had only 1 new metastatic site, as opposed to the average 2-3 found in mice of other treatment options.
- Lastly, mice on the Capomulin treatment had the highest survival rate of any treatment in the screen. Over 90% of mice treated by Capomulin survived the full duration of the trial, compared to only 35-45% of mice on other treatment options.
